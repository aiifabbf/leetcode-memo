I think this problem is related to [Stone Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game/) in which whoever plays first wins, hence the answer to Stone Game is just `return True`. There is a [game theory theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo's_theorem_(game_theory)) that supports this answer.

So, if `len(nums)` is even, then this problem is identical to Stone Game. 

However, in this problem, `len(nums)` can be odd, which means after Player 1 chooses the first or the last element, the number of the remaining stone piles becomes an even number and so Player 2 becomes virtually *the first player* in the remaining game, where Player 2 is bound to win in this local game with one exception: odd sum and even sum are equal in local game. So it is possible for Player 2 to win the whole game, if the following two conditions are both met:
- Player 1 chooses `nums[0]`, then Player 2 can choose the maximum of odd sum(sum of all elements that have odd indexes) or even sum(sum of all elements that have even indexes) from the remaining `nums[1:]` as long as he wants. Then if the difference between the odd sum and even sum `abs(oddSum - evenSum)` is greater than `nums[0]`, Player 2 wins the global game.
- Player 1 chooses `nums[1]`, then again Player 2 can choose the maximum of odd sum or even sum from the remaining `nums[:-1]` as long as he wants. Then if `abs(oddSum - evenSum)` is greater than `nums[1]`, Player 2 wins the global game.

Note that if any one of the above cases is *not* met, Player 1 wins, because he plays first, and he can force the remaining game to be on his favor.

This test case `[0, 0, 7, 6, 5, 6, 1]` is wrong from my perspective, because
- if Player 1 chooses the first element `nums[0]` which is `0`, the remaining game becomes `[0, 7, 6, 5, 6, 1]`, and Player 2 is bound to choose `[7, 5, 1]` to get a sum of 13, while Player 1 is left with `[0, 6, 6]` and a sum of 12. The difference is 1, greater than `0`. So Player 2 wins the local game and the global game. Condition 1 is met.
- if Player 2 chooses the last element `nums[-1]` which is `1`, then remaining game becomes `[0, 0, 7, 6, 5, 6]`, and Player 2 and Player 1 both get a sum of 12 and Player 1 wins the local game. The difference is 0, less than `1`. In this case, Player 1 wins the local game and the global game. Condition 2 is not met unfortunately.

So Player 1 can choose the last element `nums[-1]` in the first round, to force the game to go into `[0, 0, 7, 6, 5, 6]` where condition 2 is not met, and Player 1 wins.
